## Self-Reflection:
I learnt how to use visual studio code with GitHub.
I got to know at the end of the assignment that I wasn't supposed to commit and push everytime whenever I was commiting the changes.
I learned how to get website url using github.
I have used little javascript for the first time.
I got the chance to explore GitHub.

### How long it took me to finish this?

It took me about 5-7 hours because GitHub is very different from everything.
